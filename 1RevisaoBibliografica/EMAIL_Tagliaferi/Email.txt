Dear Sir, 

I'm a researcher in the fields of artificial intelligence and at this moment myself and my researchers colleagues at my department are conducting a study to predict low back pain, chronic pain in general, neuropathic pain and leg pain making use of 5 different machine learning algorithms.

I would appreciate if you could, please, send us the data collected and explored to write your paper entitled "Artificial intelligence to improve back pain outcomes and lessons learnt from clinical classification approaches: three systematic reviews", which is one of the fundamental studies we're using as a primary guide to conduct us on our research. 

Thank you very much for your attention

Kind Regards,

Vitor Barbosa
